name: memento
version: 0.1.0.0
synopsis: |
  The "virtual DOM" technique, but not just for DOMs.
description: |
  Imperative objects have an internal state. Call the object's type 'o', and its
  state's type 'a'. We link 'o' and 'a' by converting changes to 'a' into
  imperative actions on 'o'. This way, we can use a "virtual DOM" approach to
  updating 'o': the user describes the state they want using a pure function
  which returns an 'a', and we diff this 'a' with the previous one to determine
  how to update 'o'.

  In real-life, a memento is "an object kept as a reminder or souvenir of a
  person or event". In this library, events lead to a new 'a', but this 'a' is
  ephemeral, it is the 'o' which "remembers" that the event has occurred.
