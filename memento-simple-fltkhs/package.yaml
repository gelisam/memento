synopsis: |
  Wrapping a low-level GUI library using memento: a proof-of-concept.
description: |
  Libraries which provide bindings to an upstream non-Haskell GUI library all
  have an imperative API because that's the API which the upstream library has.

  One of the goals of the 'memento' package is to make it possible to implement
  a pure API on top of those low-level bindings. Since those APIs are typically
  very large, we begin with a more achievable task: this library re-exposes a
  small part of FLTKHS, and then wrapping that smaller API using memento.
