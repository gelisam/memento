name: simple-fltkhs
version: 0.1.0.0
synopsis: |
  A very limited subset of fltkhs which only supports windows and buttons.
description: |
  Like most bindings to non-Haskell GUI libraries, fltkhs's API is very large.
  In order to demonstrate how wrapping such an API would work without being
  overburdened by details, this library exposes a small part of fltkhs via a
  much smaller, simpler API.
